# Cosimulation
Transmission Distribution Co-Simulation using first-order (Fixed Point Iteration -FPI) and second-order (Newton's/Jacobi Method).

This repository has 4 folders:

1. IEEE9Bus Model - Transmission system is IEEE 9-bus and Distribution system is OpenDSS EPRI Ckt-24.
2. IEEE39Bus Model - Transmission Sytsem is IEEE 39-bus and Distribution system is OpenDS EPRI Ckt-24.
3. OpenDSS Transmission Models - Here the IEEE 9-Bus and 13-bus transmission system is modeled and solved in OpenDSS.
4. PV Scenarios - 100 different scenarios of PV systems each scenario with 10 -100% penetration in steps of 10%
